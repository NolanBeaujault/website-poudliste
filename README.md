# La Poudliste 🎩✨

This is a fun and simple website I built for **La Poudliste**, a Harry Potter–themed student campaign at Télécom Physique Strasbourg.

## 🧙‍♂️ About the Project

The site was used during the BDE (Student Union) campaign to:
- Present our team of students (aka wizards and witches)
- Showcase our proposed activities and events
- Share the campaign schedule and social media links

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 🎯 Purpose

This project wasn’t meant to be technically advanced, but rather a playful and informative platform to support our campaign and engage with students.
